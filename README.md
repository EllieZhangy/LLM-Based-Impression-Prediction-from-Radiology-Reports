# GPT-LLM-Based-Impression-Prediction-from-Radiology-Reports
Our project aims to utilize large language models to generate accurate words for the Impression section of medical reports by leveraging patients' medical findings and background information. The primary objective is to assist physicians in optimizing their documentation process, ultimately reducing the time required for generating comprehensive reports. 

## Data
The data for this project was obtained from the University of Chicago Medicine, consisting of 789,280 de-identified radiology reports. 

## Current Progress
Several large language models are experimented including Alpaca- 7b, Medalpaca-7b, Llama 2.0-7b, Llama 2.0-13b and Mistral-7b.
